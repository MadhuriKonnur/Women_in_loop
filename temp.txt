i kept new temp text in github repo which i copied 
locally
by git add file comes under track of git. and  moves  to area  called staging
git add file  gives under git track or  git's eye and puts in staging
git commit file  gives file verioning  and  keeps under commit area
always staging, commit  are order steps . from commit area  only git push will take a data or code
